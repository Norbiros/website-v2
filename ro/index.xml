Actually, an addon isn&amp;rsquo;t much more than a userscript, a userstyle, or a combination of the two. If any of these are related, then we make them part of the same addon, under a single name.

Scratch Addons&amp;rsquo; mission is to combine all existing Scratch extensions, userscripts and userstyles, developed by several members of the Scratch community, into a single easy-to-access place, while still letting users choose which ones to enable.</description></item><item><title>Adding an Icon to a Setting Name</title><link>https://scratchaddons.com/ro/docs/develop/adding-an-icon-to-a-setting-name/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scratchaddons.com/ro/docs/develop/adding-an-icon-to-a-setting-name/</guid><description>To add an icon to a setting name without causing crashes,

Go to the manifest of your addon (addon.json) and add a property called userscripts&amp;quot;.
